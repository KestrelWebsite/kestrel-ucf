# Kestrel UCF

Welcome to **Kestrel UCF** — an autonomous videography drone initiative developed by student-led clubs at the University of Central Florida. This project aims to push the boundaries of aerial robotics by integrating intelligent computing systems into real-time drone flight and video capture.

---

## Overview

Kestrel is a cross-disciplinary initiative that merges the fields of:

- Autonomous Robotics  
- High-Quality Aerial Videography  
- Embedded Intelligence & Real-Time Computing  
- Student Innovation & Collaboration  

Built using modern web technologies, this website serves as the central hub for information, updates, and team contributions.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)  
- **Languages**: TypeScript  
- **Styling**: Custom components and utility-first Tailwind classes  
- **Hosting**: TBD (e.g. Vercel, GitHub Pages)

├── about/           # About page and content
├── admin/           # Admin interface or tooling (WIP)
├── components/      # Reusable components like NavBar, Pilot, etc.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
